Chroma Daemon
=============
Written by Ian Llewellyn

What is it?
-----------
chromad is a daemon written in C that monitors a network attached
Chromatec AM-xx. An alarm configuration file is loaded when the
daemon starts that specifies what channels the daemon should monitor
and how much silence to accept before sending a notification email.

How to install
--------------
$ make
then
$ make install

There is an init.d script that can be installed also using:
$ make install-service

An example configuration file is provided and installed into
/etc/chromad. By default, logs are stored in the /var/log/chromad
directory. The binary is installed into /usr/local/bin/.

How to run
----------
If you want to run the program manually,
$ chromad -c <name_of_configuration_file>

The command also accepts "-v -v ..." for more verbose logs. (up to 5
-v's as I recall) Be warned, the logs can really fill up if you go
beyond 2 -v's!
